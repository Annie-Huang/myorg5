==============================================

C:\react>npx create-nx-workspace
npx: installed 199 in 18.931s
? Workspace name (e.g., org name)     myorg5
? What to create in the new workspace angular           [a workspace with a single Angular application]
? Application name                    shop
? Default stylesheet format           CSS

command the above script is running:
new myorg5 --preset="angular" --appName="shop" --style="css" --interactive=false --collection=@nrwl/workspace


C:\react\myorg5>ng build shop       <<< Standard ng build
C:\react\myorg5>nx build shop       <<< Standard nx build, which is wrapping ng, BUI this will run much faster the 2nd time optimized.

C:\react\myorg5>nx test shop        <<< The same as running 'ng run shop:test', but will it be faster?


C:\react\myorg5>nx e2e shop-e2e --headless
C:\react\myorg5>nx e2e shop-e2e --watch
It default got cypress installed when you setup angular workspace:
    "cypress": "^4.1.0",
    "@nrwl/cypress": "9.2.2"


C:\react\myorg5>nx serve shop

Why do we need this script for every postinstall????
"postinstall": "ngcc --properties es2015 browser module main --first-only --create-ivy-entry-points"
https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/33100
Almost ðŸ˜ƒ ivy-ngcc does not create app versions; it transforms Angular dependencies to be in Ivy format (i.e. as if they had been compiled by ngtsc (the Ivy compiler)).
Each Angular dependency you have in your node_modules/ can have up to 4 different formats
(different sets of files) - es2015, es5, commonjs, umd - that ngcc knows how to transform.
                            ---------------------------
So, when running ivy-ngcc (now renamed to ngcc btw) without any arguments, it will transform all formats of each dependency that exist
(some dependencies may not provide all formats).


"postinstall-new": "ngcc --properties es2015 browser module main --first-only --create-ivy-entry-points && ln -sf ./nx ./node_modules/.bin/ng"
is for linux is force (f) making the symbolic (s) links (ln)
--------------

C:\react\myorg5>nx g lib ui
? Which stylesheet format would you like to use? CSS

C:\react\myorg5>nx g component item-list --project=ui --dry-run

Notice
import { UiModule } from '@myorg5/ui';
It takes a @<OrgName>/<LibName>
